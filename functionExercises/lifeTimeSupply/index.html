  <h1>Function Exercise 3: Lifetime Supply Calculator</h2>
  <p class="intro">Ever wondered how much a "lifetime supply" of your favorite snack is? Wonder no more! </p>
  <ol class="instructions">
    <li>
      Write a function named <code>calculateSupply</code> that takes 2 arguments: current age, and amount per day. It should calculate the amount the user would consume for the rest of his/her life (based on a constant max age, let's say 80, and 365 days per year). Last, it should output the result to the console. Here's an example output at 2 mandazi per day with a current age of 26 and max of 80: <code>You will need 39420 mandazi to last you until the ripe old age of 80.</code>
    </li> 
    <li>
      Bonus: Accept floating point values for amount per day, like 1.5 pizzas, and use the global <code>Math</code> object's <code>.round()</code> method to adjust the result to a whole number.
    </li>
