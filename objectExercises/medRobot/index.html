    <h1>Object Exercise 1: Who Heals The Healer?</h2>
  </div>
  <img src="assets/mediRobot.png" style="height:250px; margin: 100px auto 0;">
  <p class="intro" style="margin-top: 30px;">A lost medical robot was found trudling around near your encampment. People in your community desperately need it. Unfortunately, its software seems to have been hacked and it has a lot of errors. You must fix it!</p>
  <ol class="instructions">
    <li>
      Using the chrome dev console, diagnose the problems and attempt to debug the robot's software in <code>index.js</code>. There are two main objects: the robot itself, and an external instruction set. Both need fixing!
    </li> 
    <li>
      Now it runs, and the <code>greet</code> method works (test it out with a name (<code>string</code>) as the argument), but it won't perform its <code>heal</code> method (try to run it with a bodypart (<code>string</code>)). It seems to be locked to a certain location. Unlock it.
    </li>
    <li>
      Even when you've fixed eR42, eR42 still sometimes makes mistakes (try the <code>heal</code> method a few times on different bodyparts) - it says that the condition is <code>undefined</code>. Why is that? Fix it.
    </li>
    <li>
      Currently the eR42 has a 50% chance of healing the patient - that's pretty bad. Adjust it up to 85%. 100% wouldn't be any fun, would it?
    </li>
    <li>
      Wait a second... if something is diagnosed as 'missing', can eR42 heal it? I don't think so. Fix the <code>performHeal</code> method of the <code>medRobotInstructionSetV14</code> object by implementing a conditional that automatically returns false if the condition is 'missing'.
    </li>
