  <h1>Object Exercise 1: Who Heals The Healer?</h2>

  <p style="margin: 50px; font-size: 1.3em; padding: 20px; border: 5px dotted white; background-color: black; color: white; line-height: 30px">A lost medical robot was found trudling around near your encampment. People in your community need it desperately. Unfortunaltey, its software seems to have been hacked and it has a lot of errors.</p>
  <ol style="text-align: left; margin: 0 50px 0 50px; font-size: 1.2em; line-height: 50px;">
    <li>
      Using the chrome dev console, diagnose the problems and attempt to fix the robot's software in <code>index.js</code>.
    </li> 
    <li>
      Now it runs, and the <code>greet</code> method works (test it out with a name as the argument), but it won't perform its <code>heal</code> method (try to run it). It seems to be locked to a certain location. Unlock it.
    </li>
    <li>
      Even when you've fixed eR42, eR42 still sometimes makes mistakes (try the <code>heal</code> method a few times on different bodyparts) - and says that the condition is 'undefined'. Why is that? Fix it.
    </li>
    <li>
      Currently the eR42 has a 50% chance of healing the patient - that's pretty bad. Adjust it up to 85%. 100% wouldn't be any fun, would it?
    </li>
    <li>
      Wait a second... if something is diagnosed as 'missing', can eR42 heal it? I don't think so. Fix the <code>performHeal</code> method of the <code>medRobotInstructionSetV14</code> object by implementing a conditional that automatically returns false if the condition is 'missing'.
    </li> 
  </ol>
