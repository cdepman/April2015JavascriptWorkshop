  <h2>OBJECT EXERCISE 1: WHO HEALS THE HEALER?</h2>
  <p>A Medical Robot was found rolling around near your encampment. People in your community need it desperately. Its software seems to have been hacked and it has a lot of errors.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Using the chrome dev console, diagnose the problems and attempt to fix the robot's software.
    </li> 
    <li>
      Now it runs but it seems to be locked to a certain location. Unlock it.
    </li>
    <li>
      Even when you've fixed eR42, eR42 still sometimes makes mistakes (try the heal method a few times on different bodyparts) - and says that the condition is 'undefined'. Why is that? Fix it.
    </li>
    <li>
      Currently the eR42 has a 50% chance of healing the patient - that's pretty bad. Adjust it up to 80%.
    </li>
    <li>
      Wait, if something is diagnosed as 'missing', can eR42 heal it? I don't think so. Fix the performHeal method of the medRobotInstructionSetV14 object by implementing a conditional that automatically returns false if the condition is 'missing'.
    </li> 
  </ol>
